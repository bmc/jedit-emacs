This directory contains a set of key bindings and some BeanShell macros for
the popular jEdit editor. The key bindings and macros, together, attempt to
provide a better emulation of the GNU Emacs editor than is available out of
the box with jEdit. Some of the key bindings in the shortcuts file merely
bind to existing jEdit macros; however, others bind to macros provided by
this package.

To install, see the "INSTALL" file.

There are probably better ways to accomplish some of the things the macros
do; I'm not a jEdit expert. Feel free to send corrections, suggestions,
enhancements and bug fixes to me at this address:

                 bmc /at/ clapper.org

NOTICE: This emulation software is not part of, or endorsed by, the GNU Emacs
project or the Free Software Foundation, nor is it a part of, or endorsed by,
the jEdit project.
