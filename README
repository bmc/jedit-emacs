This directory contains a series of BeanShell macros for use with the jEdit
Programmer's Editor (http://www.jedit.org/). These macros, and the
accompanying "shortcuts.properties" file, emulate various editor
capabilities available in the popular GNU Emacs editor.

To install, see the "INSTALL" file.

There are probably better ways to accomplish some of the things the macros
do; I'm not a jEdit expert. Feel free to send corrections, suggestions,
enhancements and bug fixes to me at this address:

                 bmc /at/ clapper.org

Emacs project or the Free Software Foundation.
